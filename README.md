# Automatic Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System üöóüíª

The **Automatic Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System** is a cost-effective, real-time solution for license plate recognition using the **Raspberry Pi**. It integrates **computer vision** techniques with **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to identify and process license plates efficiently. This project leverages tools such as **OpenCV**, **Tesseract OCR**, and **Python** to deliver robust functionality for traffic monitoring, law enforcement, and access control systems.
